# IDAssignment Project 1

For this project, I chose project example idea 2 which is to build a website to showcase my personal portfolio. Portfolios are a great method to show, not just tell, the skills you'd mention on a CV or discuss in an interview. Users can view my website and get a basic understanding on what I do and achieved throughout my life.

## Design Process

This website is for employers who potentially wants to employ me if they are satisfied enough with the work that I have achieved. Putting your experience, history and achievements might not be enough to fit in a resume or CV. Therefore, a personal portfolio website is the best way to show case all of these things to employers. 

## Features

These are the features that my website offers:

- Feature 1 - A Home page, allows user to have a general idea on what the website will be
- Feature 2 - An About page, allows user to have a basic idea on my life and a picture of me. There is a LinkedIn button for the user to click in. Once click, it will direct the user to my LinkedIn page where they can explore around and found out more about me.
- Feature 3 - A Skills page, allows user to know what skills I provide and an explanation.
- Feature 4 - An Educational History page, allows user to know which school that I've been to and how many years I studied in that school.
- Feature 5 - A Contact me page, allows user to send me a private message if they have any queries. They can also find me email address in this page.
- Feature 6 - Compatible with smaller screen or devices to view my wesbite
